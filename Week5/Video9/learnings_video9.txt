Learning Notes ‚Äì Responsive Design with @media
1. What is Responsive Design?
    Responsive Design = making a webpage look good on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
    Goal: adapt layout, font sizes, and element proportions dynamically.

2. üõ†Ô∏è The @media Rule
    @media (condition) {
        /* CSS rules here */
    }
    Applies styles only if the condition is true.
    Common conditions:
    min-width ‚Üí applies when screen is at least X pixels wide.
    max-width ‚Üí applies when screen is at most X pixels wide.
    min-width AND max-width ‚Üí applies only between a range.

    Example
    @media (max-width: 768px) {
        body { background: lightblue; }
    }
    Background turns light blue only on small screens (<768px).

3. Typical Breakpoints
    These are conventions, not strict rules:
        Mobile: <768px
        Tablet: 768px ‚Äì 1023px
        Desktop: ‚â•1024px

4. Best Practices
    Mobile-first approach
    Start with styles for smallest screens.
    Add @media (min-width: ‚Ä¶) for bigger ones.
    Flexbox/Grid + media queries = responsive powerhouse.
    Flexbox handles row/column changes.
    Media queries adjust proportions.

5. Key Takeaway
    @media queries allow CSS rules to adapt to screen size.
    Start small ‚Üí scale up with breakpoints.
    Combine with flexbox/grid for powerful layouts.
