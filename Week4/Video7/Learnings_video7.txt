🔲 content-box (default)
width and height apply only to the content area.
Padding and border are added outside the declared width/height.
Example: width: 200px; padding: 20px; border: 5px; → total width = 200 + 40 + 10 = 250px.

🔳 border-box
width and height include content + padding + border.
Padding and border are squeezed inside the declared width/height.
Example: width: 200px; padding: 20px; border: 5px; → total width = 200px.

📝 Key notes
Margins are never included in either mode — they always sit outside.
border-box is usually preferred for layouts → more predictable sizing.
set * { box-sizing: border-box; } at the start of a project.
Use content-box if you want the declared size to be pure content only.
